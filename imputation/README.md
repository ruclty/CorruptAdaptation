# Imputation Methods


## Numerical Attributes(May not work for Mixed-type data)
* [Holoclean](https://github.com/HoloClean/holoclean): A statistical inference engine to impute, clean, and enrich data, mainly for numerical values.
* MICE, KNN : Implemented by [Impyute](https://pypi.org/project/impyute/)
    * Example:

## Mixed-type Attributes
* [GAIN](https://github.com/ruclty/CorruptAdaptation/tree/master/imputation/GAIN) : Impute missing data using Generative Adversarial Networks.
* [MissForest](https://github.com/stekhoven/missForest) : A nonparametric, mixed-type imputation method for basically any type of data.
* Fill with MEAN or ZERO : Statistical methods that replace the missing values with zero value (i.e., Zero), mean value (i.e., Mean)
