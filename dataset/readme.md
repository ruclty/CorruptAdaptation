## Data Sets

### Adult
[Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult.) contains personal information from the 1994 US census. Each record in the dataset corresponds to a person with mixed data types, i.e., 8 categorical and 6 numerical attribute values.
The attribute income is used as the label to predict whether the person has income larger than 50K per year (positive) or not (negative).

### EyeState
[EyeState](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State.) contains records obtained from one continuous EEG (electroencephalogram) measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. Specifically, each record has multiple attributes
corresponding to various metrics measured by the Neuroheadset, and all the attributes in the dataset are numerical. Moreover, a label corresponding to the eye state is associated with each record, which is one of two possible values, 1 (eye-closed) and 0 (eye-open).
